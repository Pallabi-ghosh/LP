              <div class="sidebar1">
                <p>I am Pallabi, a fun-loving and caring individual from India . I am living here with my husband. I am a very versatile and enthusiastic individual from India living in Denmark . I have been looking for new opportunities where I can utilise my determination , can-do attitude and show my flexibility. Before moving to Denmark, I have been a receptionist and after that a primary school teacher for almost two years. After coming to Copenhagen, my first job was in Hotel Nimb as a floor administrator and housekeeping assistant. Also I have extensively volunteered with organisations like CPH.DOX and CHART Art Fair.</p>

                    <div class="sidebar2">
                    <p>Recently, I have completed a complete course on Sketch 5 in Udemy, which consisted a full fledged hands on experience to build a web app as well as mobile application. Also, I have completed visual elements of user interface design from California Institute of the Arts (CALARTS). I have been working with Sketch since last 6 months ,as I have been very much interested in learning UX/UI design. I am learning the art of Web Design and also Front End coding languages like HTML5 and CSS. I want to be a Full-Stack web developer. I would like to build my own business web site as well.</p>
